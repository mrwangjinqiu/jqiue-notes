It's only three hundred pounds.
But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.
I don't like the model.
The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.

Of course.
You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.

After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.  
It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.

Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.  
"What's up? What's up?" someone called.  
The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.

George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.  

He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone.  
The thieves had already gone.

But George's parrot, Henry, was still there.
