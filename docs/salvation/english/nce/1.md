```text
How was the exam, Richard?  
Not too bad.  
I think I passed in English and Mathematics.  
The questions were very easy.  
How about you, Gary?  
The English and Maths papers weren't easy enough for me.  
I hope I haven't failed.  
I think I failed the French paper.  
I could answer sixteen of the question.  
They were very easy.  
But I couldn't answer the rest.  
They were too difficult for me.  
French test are awful, aren't they?  
I hate them.  
I'm sure I've got a low mark.  
Oh, cheer up! Perhaps we didn't to do badly.

He didn't write a word!

Do you like this dress, madam?  
I like the colour very much.  
It's lovely dress, but it's too small for me.

That's enough for me.  
That was very nice.  
Would you like some more?  
Yes, please.  
I'd like a cigarette, too.  
May I have one?  
Of course.  
I think there are a few in that box.  
I'm afraid it's empty.

```

## Lesson 111 The most expensive model

```text
I like television very much.
How much does it cost?
It's the most expensive model in the shop.
It costs five hundred pounds.
That's too expensive for us.
We can't afford all that money.
This model's less expensive than that one.
It's only three hundred pounds.
But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.
I don't like the model.
The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.
Can we buy it on instalments?
Of course.
You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.
Do you like it, dear?
I certainly do, but I don't like the price.
You always want the best, but we can't afford it.
Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!
Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!

Have you any small change, sir?
I'm sorry. I've got none.
I haven't got any either.
Can you change this ten-pound note, madam?
I'm afraid I can't.
Neither can I.

None of our passengers can change this note.
They're all millionaires!

So have I.

Isn't there anyone at home?
I'll knock again, Helen.
Everything's very quiet.
I'm sure there's no one at home.
But that's impossible.
Carol and Tom invited us to lunch.
Look through the window.
Can you see anything?
Nothing at all.
Let's try the back door.
Look! Everyone's in the garden.
Hello, Helen. Hello, Jim.
Everybody wants to have lunch in the garden.
It's nice and warm out here.
Come and have something to drink.
Thanks, Carol.

## Lesson 117 Tommy's breakfast

```text
When my husband was going into the dining room this morning, he dropped some coins on the floor.

There were coins everywhere. We looked for them, but we could not find them all.

While we were having breakfast, our little boy, Tommy, found two small coins on the floor.

He put them both into his mouth. We both tried to get the coins, but it was too late. Tommy had already swallowed them!

Late that morning, when I was doing the housework, My husband phoned me from the office.

'How's Tommy?' he asked.

'I don't know,' I answered,

'Tommy's been to the toilet three times this morning, but I haven't had any change yet!'

## Lesson 119 A true story

```text
Do you like stories?  
I want to tell you a true story.  
It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.

While my friend, George, was reading in bed, two thieves climbed into his kitchen.

After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.  
It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.

Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them.  
"What's up? What's up?" someone called.  
The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could.

George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.  

He turned on the light, but he couldn't see anyone.  
The thieves had already gone.

But George's parrot, Henry, was still there.  
"What's up, George?" the called.  
'Nothing, Henry,' George said and smiled.  
'Go back to sleep.'

```text
Can't you come in and have tea now, Peter?
Not yet.
I must water the garden first.

Do you have to water it now?
I'm afraid I must.
Look at it!
It's terribly dry.

What a nuisance!
Last summer it was very dry, too.
Don't you remember?
I had to water it every day.
Well, I'll have tea by myself.

That was quick!
Have you finished already?
Yes.
Look out of the window.

It's raining!
That means you don't need to water the garden.
That was a pleasant surprese.

Look, Gray!
That policeman's waving to you.
He wants you to stop.

Where do you think you are?
On a race track?
You must have been driving
at seventy miles an hour.
I can't have been.
I was doing eighty
when I overtook you.

Didn't you see the speed limit?
I'm afraid I didn't, officer.
I must have been dreaming.
He wasn't dreaming, officer.
I was telling him to drive slowly.
That's why I didn't see the sign.

Let me see your driving licence.

I won't charge you this time.
But you'd better not do it again!
Thank you.
I'll certainly be more careful.

I told you to drive slowly, Gary.
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.
Well, next time you'd better take my advice!

Will you travel by sea or by air?

It's cheaper, isn't it?>
It may be cheaper, but it takes a long time.
I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves.
Don't be so sure.
We might not go anywhere.
My wife always worries too much.
Who's going to look after the dog?
Who's going to look after the house?
